# Getting Started with My Demo App

Hello. 

This is the demo app that you assigned to me. I should admit that the given task is maybe the most closest thing to real world programming that I've experienced until today. Thanks for being so careful about hiring :) . I provide some comments about possible features and excuses in the code also I tried to answer some of your possible questions below.

- Question 1: Why you didn't use Css in Js such as styled components and etc.? 
- Answer: First of all I am not the best person about styling something from scratch :smile: I can describe myself for styling as a loyal interpreter and I have a hidden love with css. I am a little bit obsessive about performance and Css in Js libs can't be faster than pure css for now. Of course writing css in js makes lots of things easier but I am a kind of a person who still enjoys with the challenges of writing css. But I believe that there is a long and enjoyful way to go about Css/Scss for me. :)

- Question 2: Why did you use [@reduxjs/toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)?
- Answer: In the past I usually used pure redux with redux-thunk. After meeting with Reduxjs Toolkit I decided that it makes the code much more cleaner and understandable and that is why I preferred it.

- Question 3: Why you didn't use provided Manufacturer.js file?
- Answer: I just want to develop a filter algorithm from the provided products which doesn't need any information other than product data.

- Question 4: Why you didn't add the product count's in the filters pane? (It stays at the right side of the name of the filter option)
- Answer: This is my mistake I realized few hours ago before pushing the code. I could fix it by a minor sacrifice of performance but don't want to put it in code in this way.

- Question 5: Why you didn't use any css or react component library?
- I think that writing everything from scratch will be better for the demonstration of my skills. I am already skilled at ant design and bootstrap by the way.

Thanks.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
